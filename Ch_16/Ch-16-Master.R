# Remember that null here is "we do not have autocorrelation". When reject null: Unhappy!

# Critical Value Method

# DW statistic is always between 0 and 4. 
# The closer the value is to 2, the stronger the evidence of the absence of autocorrelation.
# If it is close to 0 or 4, it suggests of positive or negative autocorrelation, respectively.
# The Durbin–Watson statistic is .7981. At the .05 level of significance.
# At alpha of 0.05 with one IV and n = 20, dL = 1.20, and dU = 1.41 (Table 16-10)
# our d=0.79, d < dL, there is significant positive autocorrelation.

# Notes:
# There are several strategies to address autocorrelation in regression analysis:
# 1. Include Lagged Variables: Incorporate past values of variables into the model.
# 2. Differencing: Subtract each observation from the previous one.
# 3. ARIMA Models: Auto-regressive integrated moving average models (time series data)
# 4. Heteroscedasticity-Robust Standard Errors: Adjust standard errors.
# 5. Co-integration Analysis: Identify long-term relationships among variables.
# 6. Time Series Cross-Validation: Evaluate model performance by cross-validation.
# 7. Other Advanced Techniques: state-space models or dynamic regression models
