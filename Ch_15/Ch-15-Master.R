                     family ='binomial')
summary(simmons_model)
# glm is general linear model
# Family binomial indicates that it's a logistic regression problem
# If we have categorical IV, it should be converted to a factor first.
# You can do this using the factor function in R.

#let's focus on the coefficients
coefficients(simmons_model)

# coefficients represent change in log odds of the dependent variable
# By themselves are hard to interpret
# we need to convert them to odds ratio using exp() function 
exp(simmons_model$coefficients) # we don't need intercept
log(exp(simmons_model$coefficients)) 
# just to show the relationship between odds and log-odds

# odds-ratios interpretation for IVs
# categorical IV (card): the odds of cardholders using coupon vs non-cardholders
  # card = 3, odds of a cardholder using the coupon are 3x a non-cardholder
# continuous IV (spending): odds of using coupon increased by an additional 1k
  # spending = 1.4, for a 1k increase in spending, odds of using coupon is 40% higher

# To predict individual probabilities we use this:
predict(simmons_model, data.frame(Card = 1, Spending = 4.2), type = "response")
# type = 'response' specifies that you want predicted probabilities
# probability of a cardholder with 4.2k spending is %59.6

predict(simmons_model, data.frame(Card = 1, Spending = 4.2))
# without "type = 'response'" you will get the log odds, aka logits (ln of odds).
# logit of a cardholder with 4.2k spending is %38.7

# To convert logit "ln(p/1-p)" to probability use the inverse logit function
logit <- predict(simmons_model, data.frame(Card = 1, Spending = 4.2))

p <- 1 / (1 + exp(-logit))
print (p)
# logit value of %38 corresponds to probability value of of %59.6
